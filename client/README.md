 It depends on your target audience and the specific goals they want to track. 
 If you are targeting a broad audience, it may be more beneficial to create a goal tracker app that can track multiple goals. 
 However, if you are targeting a specific group of people with a particular goal in mind, it may be more effective to focus on one specific goal.

For example, if you are targeting students who want to track their study habits, 
it may be better to create a goal tracker app that focuses solely on tracking study time, setting study goals, and monitoring progress towards those goals. 
On the other hand, if you are targeting individuals who want to improve their overall health and fitness, 
a goal tracker app that can track multiple goals like exercise, diet, sleep, and hydration may be more appealing. 
Ultimately, it's important to understand your target audience and their specific needs to determine which approach is best.
