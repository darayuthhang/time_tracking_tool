The best type of design for a goal tracker for students will depend on several factors, 
including the target audience, their needs and preferences, 
and the functionality of the web app. However, here are some general design principles to consider:

Simple and easy to use: Students may be busy with various tasks and activities,
 so it's important to design a goal tracker that is simple and easy to use. 
 Avoid cluttered screens and too many options, as this can be overwhelming for users.

Motivating and visually appealing: A goal tracker for students should be visually 
appealing and motivating. Use colors and graphics that are associated with positivity and motivation, 
such as green or blue, and incorporate gamification elements, such as badges or rewards, 
to make tracking progress more enjoyable.

Mobile-friendly: Many students use their mobile devices for studying and 
organizing their schedules, so it's important to design a goal tracker 
that is optimized for different screen sizes, including desktop and mobile devices.

Personalization: Students may have different goals and priorities, 
so it's important to design a goal tracker that allows for personalization. 
This could include customizing the colors, adding or removing categories, and setting reminders or notifications.

Progress tracking and feedback: Incorporate visual elements such as charts, 
graphs, and progress bars to show students their progress towards their goals. 
This can be a motivating factor for students, and help them stay on track. 
Additionally, provide feedback and suggestions to help students improve their performance.

Overall, the design of a goal tracker for students should be user-friendly, 
visually engaging, and personalized to meet their needs and preferences. 
By creating a well-designed goal tracker, students can improve their productivity, 
time management, and overall academic performance.

 - Ultimately, the popularity of web apps vs mobile apps for 
 tracking tasks will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the students using them. A well-designed and useful 
 app, regardless of whether it's a web app 
 or mobile app, will be more likely to be used regularly by students.



Identify a problem: 
Many successful startups have been born from identifying a 
problem that people face and finding a way to solve it. 
Think about problems you or others around you experience 
and consider how you can provide a solution.

Follow your passion: 
Startups that are based on a founder's passion or interest 
often have a higher chance of success. 
Consider what you enjoy doing and how you can turn that into a business idea.

Build on existing ideas: 
Look at existing products or services and think about 
how you can improve upon them or create a better version.

Conduct market research: 
Conducting market research can help you identify gaps in the market or areas where there is a high demand but a low supply. Consider what products or services are popular and how you can create a unique value proposition.

Collaborate with others: Brainstorming with others can be helpful in generating new ideas and identifying opportunities. Collaborate with like-minded individuals, join online communities, or attend networking events to connect with people who share your interests and can provide valuable insights.
